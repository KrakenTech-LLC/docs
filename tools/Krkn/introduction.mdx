# First Time Setup

Upon launching the Krkn Server if a database does not yet exist, the user will be prompted to begin the first time setup process.

### Specifying a Sending Email

In order to begin a new Krkn server, a sending email must be provided. Currently only outlook email addresses are supported.

This sending email will be used to add new users to the Krkn Server.

Next, an app password must be provided for the sending email. This can be generated at the [Microsoft Security Info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) page.

### Admin User

After selecting a sending email, the admin user must be created. To do so, we first supply a username followed by an email address.

Once the admin user information has been populated, a token email will be sent to the admin user from the sending email.

### Confirming the Token

Once the token is received, the user can then provide it to the Krkn Server to verify receipt and initialize the server.
